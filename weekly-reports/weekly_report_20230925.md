## Bob Tianqi Wei, Technology Design Foundations

### Summary: 


In Thursday's TDF class, I was guided by the instructor to set up the Photon 2 to connect to Berkeley IoT's Wi-Fi and run simple programs: using serial and lighting up small lights. This got me introduced to the microcontroller and ready to continue using it to make more fun things in the future. In Monday's session, we were divided into groups and I brainstormed with my group members and we discussed solutions based on the topic of mobility. In the second half of the classlecture, one of the speakers described the experience of making some musical instruments using special materials and Arduino, which was very inspiring for me. The use of conductive materials, fabric and paper was very interesting.

I successfully ran hello world in the online IDE and saw the text I changed in the serial monitor!

I succeeded in getting the LEDs to blink!

The photocell reads the data.

I combined the program for the photoresistor with hello world and now the two functions are displayed alternately.

During Monday's session, our group had a discussion.

### Reflections:

A lot of times I should follow tutorials to learn new things instead of trying them without a clue.

### Speculations:

This open source hardware set I got for this class has a lot of really interesting sensors in it, and I'm really looking forward to making interesting things for future classes!
