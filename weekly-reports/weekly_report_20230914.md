#Weekly Report 09/14/2023
## Bob Tianqi Wei, Technology Design Foundations

### Summary: 


In this week's TDF course, I learned the fundamentals of Grasshopper modeling very clearly. It's been a great start for me in grasping Grasshopper. With the knowledge I gained, I was able to create a new phone stand based on the files provided in the tutorial, tailored to my own needs, and 3D printed it. Moreover, during the process of making this phone stand, I identified areas in my design that needed improvement. It made me realize the importance of more careful consideration in my designs, as there are still some aspects of my phone stand that require refinement. This is what I have learned.

It's funny because I don't know which one of my classmates always changes my name to a really weird font.


I signed up for a workshop at Jacobs Hall equipments and the instructor took us out to actually work with the laser cutting equipment and solved a problem one of my classmates was having: setting up the correct size in Illustrator to get a cell phone holder cut to the correct size when cutting it. I also learned about the ability to locate a specific position on a board in the laser cutter software, which is especially useful when we want to utilize a board that has already been used, allowing us to save material and make the best use of it.

### Reflections:

This week's lesson made me think about the tools I'm learning and using for those scenarios? Many of the tools we normally use such as online documents (Google, Microsoft, Kingsoft) have attributes such as online collaboration, but tools such as Figma and Miro are better suited to design as they can be displayed in real time and are more feature rich. But I also thought about whether Figma is suitable for all scenarios such as event registration, because if there are too many users, you don't know who did what and it can cause confusion.

### Speculations:

n the next few weeks, I will hopefully learn more about the tools in the TDF course and apply them to my future studies and work.
