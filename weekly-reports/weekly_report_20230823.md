#Weekly Report 08/31/2023
## Bob Tianqi Wei, Technology Design Foundations

### Summary: 

This week in the TDF course, I learned the basics of using tools like Rhino, Grasshopper, and Figma. Additionally, I had the opportunity to create a phone stand using a laser-cutting machine. Prior to this, I completed safety training for Jacobs Hall equipment, which will enable me to utilize these resources more effectively for future creative projects.

During my undergraduate studies, I gained experience with Rhino and used it extensively for various assignments, including my graduation project. However, I had never worked with Grasshopper, a parametric design tool, before. This week marked my introduction to Grasshopper, expanding my skill set beyond basic 3D modeling in Rhino.

Here is a link to some video documentation I made of my cell phone stand getting cut at Jacobs!  :)
I did have some issues with heat level, which I brought up to one of my instructors.

### Reflections:

Initially I broke out the measuring tools that came to mind.

I took measurements of my phone and realized that I was measuring in inches, but that the file requires millimeters.  I measured again and it worked out well.
I eventually ended up using digital calipers that I found in the Makerspace, because I didn't feel like a standard ruler was accurate enough.

I was able to locate the UI grasshopper panel by navigating in Rhino3d to the "panels" pane and selecting the grasshopper icon.  I found that I needed to disable it from view before re-enabling.

Here are some shots of my explorations of the CellPhoneStand file:

I spent some evaluating the CellPhoneStand_forGrasshopper files and had a few realizations:

1. The .stl file is a product of the parameters in the Grasshopper UI, and needs to be exported
2. The model shown in the display is a specific height, but I need not worry about that because I'm overriding this when I enter in new data into the UI Grasshopper panel
3. The point cloud representing the field of view is not calculated on the fly, but is a demonstrable as to what sort of considerations a designer would need to be taking into account when

### Speculations:

I think that in the upcoming weeks, I want to use this stand for video/still documentation of the work I do.  It will hopefully make my weekly reports easier in the sense that I can manipulate whatever physical objects I am working with during the video recording.  I suspect the faculty of TDF may ask me to make an introductory video about myself in which I discuss the reasons I'm here in the program.  It seems that there was an invitation to have this conversation in the [shared slack channel](https://berkeleymdes.slack.com/archives/C05JZF3EJUU)
