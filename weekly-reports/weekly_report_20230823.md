#Weekly Report 08/31/2023
## Bob Tianqi Wei, Technology Design Foundations

### Summary: 

This week in the TDF course, I learned the basics of using tools like Rhino, Grasshopper, and Figma. Additionally, I had the opportunity to create a phone stand using a laser-cutting machine. Prior to this, I completed safety training for Jacobs Hall equipment, which will enable me to utilize these resources more effectively for future creative projects.

During my undergraduate studies, I gained experience with Rhino and used it extensively for various assignments, including my graduation project. However, I had never worked with Grasshopper, a parametric design tool, before. This week marked my introduction to Grasshopper, expanding my skill set beyond basic 3D modeling in Rhino.

I used a laser-cutting machine to create this phone stand. During the process, I learned how to adjust line width and line color to control the laser cutter's functionality effectively.

However, on the initial attempt, even with all parameters correctly set, the laser didn't cut through the wood entirely. I noticed that some classmates tried to remove the stand immediately after the first incomplete cut, which resulted in the wood splitting. So, I decided to recut it in the same location, and the result was very satisfying.

### Reflections:

During the laser-cutting assignment, I engraved my name, "Bob" (in an abstract form), on the bottom plate of the phone stand. However, I didn't consider the final assembly's effect, resulting in my name being obscured once it was put together. This was a hasty oversight in my design. In the future, I will be more thorough in my design considerations.

### Speculations:

In the upcoming weeks, I will diligently study the knowledge covered in the TDF course and strive to become proficient in using these tools to enhance my design work. This is also my first time using GitHub and markdown, and I believe these tools will be beneficial for me.
